        <li>Bring your own water and refrain from sharing water bottles.</li>
        <li>When arriving at the grounds, please set up your spot in a socially distanced
            manner.</li>
        <li>Please wear a mask anytime you are not actively officiating while at the
            grounds.</li>

    <h3>During the match</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mask wearing is not required while officiating on field. However, you may
            choose to do so.</li>
        <li>Try to keep as much distance as feasible while still maintaining a solid
            presence, particularly at scrum time. Use your best judgement on balancing rugby saftey with pandemic
            safety.</li>
        <li>If possible, use a mask or a gaiter while having close chats during a match
            like speaking to a captain about an issue.</li>
        <li>Refrain from using any team water bottles if offered.</li>
    </ul>

<div fxLayout="row">
    <h3>After the match</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Again, wear a mask when on the sidelines or not actively officiating while at
            the grounds.</li>
        <li>It's recommended to wipe down flags with a bleach wipe (or something similar)
            if sharing that equipment.</li>
