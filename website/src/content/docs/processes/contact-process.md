description: When, how, and what to contact the referee about
---

The primary and preferred communication method should be email. RefUp provides an easy way to email your referee(s) once they're assigned. See their <a href='https://refup.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44001787764-contacting-officials' target='_blank'>documentation</a> for details.

In situations where RefUp is not being used, communication will run through the Society contact.

## What information to send your referee(s)

Your referee(s) need to have you send the following information:

- Home jersery, short, and sock color.
- Visitor jersery, short, and sock color.
- Directions to the field if address in RefUp doesn't play nice with GPS.
- Kick off time if different than listed in RefUp.
- Directions to the social (if applicable).

:::caution
Failure to do so could result in loss of referee assignemnt to your match.

It is the responsibility of the host club/org to communicate these details. If this does not happen, the referee is not obligated to confirm.
