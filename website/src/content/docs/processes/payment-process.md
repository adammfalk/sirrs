Organizations or clubs representing senior and collegiate sides in the Iowa Rugby Union will make payments through the RefUp platform. Payments will be collected either through automation or through invoices on the RefUp platform. No other payment forms will be accepted.

For organizations not in the above category, an invoice will be sent independent of RefUp before the event with payment due upon receipt.
