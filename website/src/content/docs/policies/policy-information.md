These are the policies by which SIRRs operates. This includes what services we are chartered to provide and work towards. It also includes the processess that we have in place for interacting with us.

## Mission Statement

The Society of Iowa Rugby Referees (SIRRs) was formed with the specific purposes

- to foster the growth and development of the amateur sport of Rugby in the United States and particularly in Iowa;
- to increase the awareness of Rugby, its traditions and dedication to amateurism and the amateur game of Rugby as opposed the professional game of Rugby;
- to advance interest and participation in the game, and in other amateur sports, both in the United States and other countries;
- to foster the application of the Laws of the Game as adopted by the World Rugby;
- to foster the development of refereeing and match officiating skills in its Members and Non-Members alike;
- to promote the advancement of referees to the Midwest Territorial Panel, USA Rugby's Referee and Laws Committee (RLC) Pathways system including its Regional Development Group (RDG) and National Development Group (NDG), the National Referee Team and Major League Rugby, and the International Panel;
- to do any other act or thing incidental to, or connected with the foregoing purposes, or in advancement thereof, but not for pecuniary profit or financial gain of its Members, Officers or Directors.

## Services

The primary service that SIRRs provides is connecting certified, competent, and qualified match officials to organizations operating within the geographic boundaries of Iowa for the purpose of meeting <a href='https://www.world.rugby/the-game/laws/law/6' target='_blank'>Law 6</a> in the game of rugby union.

Said plainely, we provide referees, and other match officials as requested and required, to clubs and organizations (partners) to have a game of governing body sanctioned rugby happen.

Additionally, we work to ensure our members and partners are kept current on law and law application. This work takes many forms, but most commonly is through communication and, since the pandemic, virtual sessions.

## Assignments

For senior and collegiate match assignments, SIRRs uses [RefUp](/referee-resources/refup) once [requests](/policies/request-a-referee) have been created. These assignments are posted [here](/assignments).

For the <a href='https://iayra.org' target='_blank'>Iowa Youth Rugby Association</a> high school 7s competitions, assignments are driven through a private communication channel.

Assignments may be posted on public social media channels like <a href='https://www.facebook.com/iowarugbyrefs' target='_blank'>Facebook</a>.
