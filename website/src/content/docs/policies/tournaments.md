description: Our policies for match officials at tournaments

These policies are in place in order to provide sufficient time for logistics, as well as adequate referee numbers with safety and match official welfare in mind.

## Schedule submission

A solidified schedule needs to be submitted no later than 7 days in advance of the tournament. The number of matches should not increase from this point forward. Any changes should be communicated to the Society ahead of time.

## Amenities

Referees will require access to water, shade/shelter, and food while working a tournament. These amenities should be made clear to the Society contact or the referees ahead of time so they can make any necessary, additional plans for their well-being during the day.

If a tournament is a two day event, hotel accommodations may be required. These are to either be arranged by the tournament host, or expenses will be billed to the hosts after the fact.
