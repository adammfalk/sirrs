## Payment processing

If you are a [senior or collegiate Iowa Rugby Union club](policies/request-a-referee#requests-from-iowa-rugby-union-senior-and-collegiate-clubs), match fees are paid automatically from your configured payment source in RefUp the evening of your event. See RefUp's <a href='https://refup.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44001292597-paying-with-a-credit-card' target='_blank'>help</a> for more info. There is also an <a href='https://refup.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44002507416-invoice-payments' target='_blank'>invoice process</a> that is available in extreme cases. At this time, no other payment forms are accepted.

If you are an [org that does not fit in the above description](policies/request-a-referee#requests-from-other-organizations), arrangements will be made on a case by case basis.
