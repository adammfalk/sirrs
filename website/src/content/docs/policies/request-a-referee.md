Our policies and processes for requesting a referee, or referees, for a rugby event in Iowa.

:::tip
It is the responsibility of the host/scheduling team to keep logistic information up to date either in RefUp or by sending notice to the LRO contact.
:::

## Requests from Iowa Rugby Union senior and collegiate clubs

:::note
Requests must be built by the host club/organization at least 3 weeks in advance of the event. Failure to do so may result in the event being unstaffed.
:::

Requests for a referee start in RefUp. Use their <a href="https://refup.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44001292543-making-your-first-bid" target="_blank">help article</a> for guidance.

Be sure to select `Match` for a 15's match or `Tournament` for a 7's or 10's tournament. If you are hosting multiple 15s matches but not in a tournament (like a triangular), please use `Tournament`.

If this doesn't fit your needs, or you are a club or entity not in RefUp, please reach out directly.

When you build an event in RefUp, you're prompted to enter the date, address, and number of matches (in the case of a tournament). This is the authoritative version of this information. Referees will use this information!

## Requests from other organizations

Sometimes there are cases where using RefUp does not make sense. These cases are primarily when organizations outside of Iowa need to use our services. If this case applies to you, please reach out directly through email as soon as possible, to get the ball rolling.

## Tournament requests

:::note
Tournament requests must be built by the host club/organization no later than 4 weeks before the event.
:::

Be sure to read our [tournament policies](/policies/tournaments).

Tournaments are [charged](/policies/fees) on a per-match structure. There may be additional fees for tournaments depending on scope and schedule. These fees may include a Referee Manager fee or fees for hotels for referees, if required.

The `Number of Matches` info field on the request helps us figure out how many referees your tournament requires to work the event safely. When you create the bid, use your best guess. As details about this come into place, please keep this information point up to date!
