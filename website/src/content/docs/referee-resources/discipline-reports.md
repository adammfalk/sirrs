## Writing a report

Discipline reports are your statement of the event. Stick to the facts of what you saw. Do not make assumptions on lack of intent and avoid editorializing.

An example report for a dangerous tackle with head/neck contact:

> Tackler Jack McQuincy was in a legal position, launched upwards, and their shoulder made direct head contact. I was approximately 8 feet away from the event with clear sight.
>
> Foul play? Yes - tackle was made above the shoulder line.
> Head contact? Yes.
> Degree of danger/force? High - head was the principle contact point.
> Mitigating factors? No other players were involved in the tackle, no dramatic change in height, static situation, no mitigating factors.
> Red card to McQuincy at 57:35.

An example without the head contact process:

> Team was under a general warning for repeat tackle infringements. Blue #12 Linda Boeckler made a tackle and rolled directly into arriving scrum half trying to clear the ball. PK to #12 for not rolling away and a YC for repeat infringements at the tackle at 31:44. I was around 5 feet away.

## Filing a report for senior or collegiate cards

Discipline reports are a part of the <a href='https://refup.io/matches/mine' target='_blank'>RefUp Match Report</a> process. Please fill out with as much information as possible. Registration Number is not required since that is not easy-to-find public information any longer.

Reports for collegiate players will be forwarded along to their competition conference contacts along with your information if further questions in the discipline process arise.

### Midwest competitions (senior club)

Report any yellow or red cards for Midwest sanctioned senior competition <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0vrDCtqezR3pxFFFKpUhLRuV6nOQ80SrLaMlO_z_V66EVZA/viewform' target='_blank'>here</a>. This will be seen by the Iowa and Midwest disciplinary/compliance officers.

## High School (IAYRA) competitions

Red cards must be reported in the high school leagues. These are reported when filling out the <a href='https://forms.gle/2gQSzEXYm3VXvDht9' target='_blank'>Score Report/Payment form</a>.
