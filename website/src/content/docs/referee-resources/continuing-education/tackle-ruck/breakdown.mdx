## Pre-tackle/contact

Be aware of the context of the moment in the match.

- Is the contact a situation that is dynamic or static?
- Where on the field are the teams right now?
- Who is applying pressure and who is feeling pressure?

## Tackle

See <a href='https://www.world.rugby/the-game/laws/law/14' target='_blank'>Law 14</a>.

For a tackle to occur, the ball-carrier is held and brought to ground by one or more opponents.
Being brought to ground means that the ball-carrier is lying, sitting or has at least one knee on the ground or on another player who is on the ground.
Being held means that a tackler must continue holding the ball-carrier until the ball-carrier is on the ground.

## Tackle priorities

1. Ensure the tackler (and tackle-assist, when appropriate) release and roll away or don't interfere with arriving players or the tackled player exercising their rights.
   :::tip[Tackler/Tackle-Assist Tips]
   Tacklers should roll as though the floor is lava.

   Tacklers should also roll east/west and not impede arriving support players.

   If they are slow **and it makes the offense wait to play the ball**, they are liable to PK.

   Tackle-assists need a clear and obvious release. If you need a replay to see it, it's not clear and obvious.
   :::

2. Tackled player must immediately make the ball available (placing or passing) and not prevent players on their feet from playing the ball.
   :::tip[Tackled Player Tips]
   Tackled players get one (1) move. Watch for extra rolls when isolated.
   :::

3. Arriving players are entering the breakdown legally and safely while maintaining positive body positions/not leaving their feet.
   :::tip[Arriving Player Tips]
   The "gate" is as wide/narrow/tall/short as the tackle box. It must be entered square, but players can use angles after legal entry.

   Ensure arriving support players are in a positive body position and not cynically sealing off/going off feet.

   The jackal is first arriving player on the tackler's team who can contest for possession _at the tackle only_ by remaining on their feet. If involved at the tackle, they must move away and re-enter through their side of the gate before contesting possession. To reward a jackal, they must be contesting possession by winning the race, grasping/holding the ball and a pull, showing they are denied possession by the tackled ball carrier.
   :::

Clean up the tackle will set you up for positive rucks. If the tackle is garbage, it will flow downhill and make the ruck garbage. Player frustration will mount and _pressure will be put onto you_ as opposed to the players, where it belongs.

## Ruck

See <a href='https://www.world.rugby/the-game/laws/law/15' target='_blank'>Law 15</a>.

For a ruck to occur, there must be one player from each side are in contact, on their feet, and over the ball.

## Ruck priorities

1. Locate the ball.
   Is the ball available? If not, why? Respond accordingly.
2. Is the ball out?
   - the ball is out where there are no bodies over the ball
   - digging for the ball is not out
   - hand on the ball is not out, but lifting the ball _is_ out
   - when in doubt, the ball is not out
3. Have the team in possession use it.
   - when the ball is clearly won, and available to be played, referee will say "use it" and the ball must be played within 5 seconds (<a href='https://www.world.rugby/the-game/laws/law/15' target='_blank'>15.17</a>).
