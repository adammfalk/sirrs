Scrums are one of the most difficult parts of refereeing 15s. Let's try to simplify things.

Granted, this isn't the whole story. But something is better than nothing.

## Pressure

There is a lot of mystique around the "Dark Arts" that obscures the simple fact that scrums are about application of force to produce pressure. 

Granted, there is a lot that can go into scrummaging from a tacical standpoint, and with the amount of bodies and the complexities of their competing priorities, it's no surprise that scrum coaching is a very deep and important component of a team. But by pulling away some of the branding, we can try to focus on the bigger picture events as they relate to law.

:::note
Pressure is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.<sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure' target='_blank'>*</a></sup>
