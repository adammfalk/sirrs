Here is a snippet of an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Joubert" target="_blank">Craig Joubert</a>, a former international, and Olympic, referee from South Africa. Here he talks about an intentional decision he made with regards to his positioning and running lines. He strove to give himself consistent vantages of the breakdown (enabling him to make consistent and clear calls) as well as focusing on ball-in-line running.
