description: How to work matches in the high school leagues
---

If you are wanting to work for either the boys or girls high school 7s leagues, assignments are made via a more manual process.

Communication will run through the league's channel on <a href='https://sportsyou.com/groups/te-62ecf1a2-1003-49f2-9613-5f8797d0ba7a' target='_blank'>SportsYou</a>. There is also an app to install, if you wish. If you are not a member, or are unsure, please reach out to Society leadership to be added.

Availability is input onto a shared spreadsheet. Please put any notes (like you need to be at a location with a certain team, or you can only work a certain site, or you only want to AR, etc) alongside the availability. The sheet will look something like this:

| Referee name   | Date 1           | Date 2      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Samantha Smith | Y                | N           |
| George Clem    | N                | Y - AR only |
| Alex Auburns   | Y (with CR Wash) | N           |

Match reports are to be filled out within 24 hours. You must submit your scores, and [any red cards](/referee-resources/discipline-reports) as well, <a href='https://forms.gle/2gQSzEXYm3VXvDht9' target='_blank'>here</a>.

Payments will be made direct from the league. Any questions should be routed to the high school coordinator or the league leadership.
